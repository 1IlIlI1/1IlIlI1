My gits are probably going to be mods for games.  Maybe, eventually try and do VSTs.

I really love the idea of code and computing but I have no confidence, no accredidation, or any idea how to start 'it' or do anything.  Syntax?  I have to think about what bool means.  Void public what?  I like the idea of objects and statements.  I like math and logic.  I am interested in Carbon.  Kitlin.
I dunno if I should focus on C++ or just try and learn Java and try and make mods for Minecraft.  I dunno.  Whatever.
